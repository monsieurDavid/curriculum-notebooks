    "### Algorithm: \n",
    "\n",
    "Step by step solution of a problem with a definite goal. Consider how we solve our day to day problems. on a typical day, you start on report, and after completing a paragraph, you perform spell ckeck. You then think about later part of the report and do some searching in the internet using the web browser. So if you think about the whole process of report writing and breakdown into steps as the operation you performed will give you a procedure for writing a report. \n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a well-defined procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem. Another way to describe an algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions. The use of the term 'unambiguous' indicates that there is no room for subjective interpretation. Every time you ask your computer to carry out the same algorithm, it will do it in exactly the same manner with the exact same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Do Algorithms Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple example of an algorithm would be to find the largest number in an unsorted list of numbers. If you were given a list of three different numbers, you will need no computers to find that out. Now, how about five million different numbers? Clearly, you are going to need a computer to do this, and a computer needs an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary task of creating an algorithm is to define the following criterias:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **input**: there are zero or more quantities which are externally supplied. Try to figure out what the problem needs, how much does it need and how it will recieve the data. For Example: think of the input for changing a tire.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **output**: at least one quantity or outcome is produced;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **definiteness**: each instruction must be clear and unambiguous; Unambiguous means it can not conflict with any other instructions, like sendind the same people two different places at the same time which is not physically possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **finiteness**: if we trace out the instructions of an algorithm, then for all cases the algorithm will terminate or end after a finite number of steps;\n",
    "\n",
    "* **effectiveness**: every instruction must be sufficiently basic that it can in principle be carried out by a person using only pencil and paper. It is not enough that each operation be definite, but it must also be feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets create an algorithm thats finds the largest number in a unsorted list of numbers. Lets name the list A. So the first number in list would be A1, A2 be the second number and so on. As we know the list is not sorted - otherwise, the answer would be really easy. So, for this algorithm the input is a list of numbers, and the output should be the largest number in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Let set the Largest number = A1\n",
    "This means you start by assuming that the first number is the largest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: For each item in the list:\n",
    "This means you will go through the list of numbers one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: If the itemLargest:\n",
    "If you find a new largest number, move to step four. If not, go back to step two, which means you move on to the next number in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Then Largest = the item\n",
    "This replaces the old largest number with the new largest number you just found. Once this is completed, return to step two until there are no more numbers left in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5**: Return Largest\n",
    "\n",

    "### Recursion: \n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a method of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a small enough problem that it can be solved trivially. Usually recursion involves a function calling itself. While it may not seem like much on the surface, recursion allows us to write elegant solutions to problems that may otherwise be very difficult to program. Finally, Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself. For example, we can define the operation \"find your way home\" as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are at home, stop moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take one step toward home.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Find your way home\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the solution to finding your way home is two steps (three steps). First, we don't go home if we are already home. Secondly, we do a very simple action that makes our situation simpler to solve. Finally, we redo the entire algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets do one more examples \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Recursion:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use recursion in any problem where the answer can be obtained in an easy way, assuming you know the answer to a simpler problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you want to calculate the weight of the  9th floor of a 20 storied Plaza, and you know that each floor is half as heavy as the one below it, then you could use recursion to calculate the 9th floor based on the 20 floor (which is based on the 19h … and so on), until you reach the base floor– whose weight you would need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### generalize Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a recursive solution you may take following approach to make things easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down the simple base case\n",
    "2. Pretend that you know the answer to the case(s) that are slightly simpler than the answer\n",
    "3. Calculate the answer from the answer to the slightly simpler case(s)\n",
