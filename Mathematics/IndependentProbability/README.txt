FOR TEACHERS:

- Target audience: Grade 8

- Related Curriculum Outcome: Statistics & Probability - Chance & Uncertainty (Gr. 8)
General Outcome: Use experimental or theoretical probabilities to represent and solve problems involving uncertainty.
Specific Outcome 2: Solve problems involving the probability of independent events. 

- This notebook can be used as either an introduction to independent probabilities or as a review.

- Students will encounter: interactive graphs that allow them to simulate an independent event thousands of times, intructions on how to compute theoretical probabilities, multiple choice to quiz their knowledge, application questions centred on independent probability.

- Expected time to complete the notebook: 1 - 2 class periods (60 - 90 min)
